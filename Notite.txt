Atac:
- A stie ca e destinat lui mesajul (criptat cu Ka), dar nu stie cine a initiat comunicarea cu el (i)

A -> S: (A.B.{Na}_Ka)       % Ka is a key shared by A and S
A <- S: (A.B.{K.Na.Ns.B}_Ka.  % S generates new key K (without .A in {}_Kb, the attacker would be able to contact the server for I and B, thus obtaining K as well as being able to pretend to be A)
             {K.Na.Ns.A}_Kb)  % A cannot decrypt the contents of {K.Na.Ns}_Kb
                            % but he is able to forward that to B
A -> B: (A.B.{K.Na.Ns.A}_Kb.  % The last part is
             {Na.Ns}_K)     % a key confirmation
A <- B: (A.B.{Na.Ns.Nb}_K)  $ A tests if B knows K during this session (Ns)
A -> B: (A.B.{Nb.Ns}_K)  % B tests if A knows K during this session (Ns)
